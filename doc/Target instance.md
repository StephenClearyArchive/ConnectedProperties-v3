# Concept: Target instance

A target instance is an object instance which is being tracked by an [object tracker](Object-tracker).

Also known as: _target_, _target object_, _tracked object_, or _tracked instance_.

Every target instance has a single unique [object ID](Object-ID), which is used to track the lifetime of the target.

A target instance must be a [reference-equatable instance](Reference-equatable-instance).
