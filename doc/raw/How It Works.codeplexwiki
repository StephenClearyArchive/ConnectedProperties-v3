The Connected Properties library is just a thin wrapper around [url:ConditionalWeakTable<TKey, TValue>|http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd287757.aspx].

Each "connector" is actually an instance of ConditionalWeakTable.

The wrapper provides the following advantages over using ConditionalWeakTable directly:

* You may attach value types to carrier objects (ConditionalWeakTable values must be reference types).
* Carrier objects are checked at runtime to prevent accidentally using an improper carrier object.
* The API for accessing property values is more complete (e.g., Set) and does not have vexing exceptions (ConditionalWeakTable has a vexing exception for its Add method).
