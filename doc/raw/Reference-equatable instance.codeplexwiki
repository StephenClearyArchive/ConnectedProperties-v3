! Concept: Reference-equatable instance

A reference-equatable instance is any object whose [exact type|Exact type] is a [reference-equatable type|Reference-equatable type].

In other words, it is an object that uses reference equality, not value equality.

It is possible to have a variable of a reference-equatable type that refers to a non-reference-equatable instance. If a {{Base}} class uses reference equality, but a {{Derived}} class uses value equality, then the variable {{Base x = new Derived()}} would be a reference-equatable type but a non-reference-equatable instance.
