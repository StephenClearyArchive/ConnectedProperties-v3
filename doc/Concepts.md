* [Exact type](Exact-type) - The most-derived type of an instance.
* [GC detection thread](GC-detection-thread) - A thread that detects when [targets](Target-instance) have been garbage collected.
* [Object ID](Object-ID) - A unique ID for a [target instance](Target-instance), which also acts as a [weak reference](Weak-reference).
* [Object ID reference](Object-ID-reference) - A strongly-typed reference to an [object ID](Object-ID).
* [Object tracker](Object-tracker) - An object which tracks the lifetimes of other objects.
* [Reference-equatable instance](Reference-equatable-instance) - An instance whose [exact type](Exact-type) is a [reference-equatable type](Reference-equatable-type).
* [Reference-equatable type](Reference-equatable-type) - A type that uses reference equality.
* [Registered action](Registered-action) - A callback that is invoked when a [target instance](Target-instance) is garbage collected.
* [Target instance](Target-instance) - An instance that is tracked by an [object tracker](Object-tracker).
* [Weak reference](Weak-reference) - A logical reference to an object that does not prevent the object from being garbage-collected.
