"Connected properties" should really be called "attached properties", but that name [was already taken by WPF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749011.aspx).

Likewise, the term "bound properties" was considered (in the sense that the properties "bind" to their carrier objects), but that term [was already associated with data binding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_property).

So, I settled on the term "connected properties".
