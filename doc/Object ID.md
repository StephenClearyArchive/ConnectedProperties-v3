# Concept: Object ID

An object ID is a unique identifier for a [target instance](Target-instance) tracked by an [object tracker](ObjectTracker).

In addition to being a unique identifier, the object ID also acts as a [weakly-typed weak reference](Weak-reference) and supports [registering actions](Registered-action).

In the Nito.Weakness library, the [ObjectId](ObjectId) type is an object ID.
